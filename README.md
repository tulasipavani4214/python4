1.Cassandra: Cassandra is a high-performance and highly scalable distributed NoSQL database management system. Cassandra deals with unstructured data and handles a high volume of incoming data velocity. In Cassandra data is written in many locations also data come from many locations this row represents a unit of replication and the column represents a unit of storage. 
RDBMS: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a Database management system or software that is designed for relational databases and uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and maintaining the database. It deals with structured data and handles moderate incoming data velocity. In RDBMS mainly data is written in one location also data come from one/few locations and a row represents a single record column that represents an attribute.

RDBMS handles moderate incoming data velocity.

7.
In RDBMS there is limited data source means data come from many locations.
In Cassandra there are various data source means data come from one/few location.
